# Database Final Project

This project includes the HTML and PHP files with the code to the website found in the [csmath.uprm.edu](https://csmath.uprm.edu/comp4018.php) website.

## About

This is a project made for our Database Systems course. The purpose of this project was for us to view and practice making queries to a database stored on a 
server by using PHP to communicate within the server and receive the data stored in the databases found in the MariaDB relational database management system 
(RDBMS) and phpMyAdmin is used to administer it.

## Features

On the website, you can:
- View, modify, and make queries on the data stored in the databases.
- Get access to the code via the hyperlink to this repository in the webpage.
